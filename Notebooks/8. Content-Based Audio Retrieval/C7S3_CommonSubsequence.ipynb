    "## Alignment Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, we want to briefly reflect on various alignment scenarios and the principles behind them. The general objective of **sequence alignment** is to identify regions of similarity \n",
    "that are shared by two given sequences $X=(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)$ and $Y=(y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_M)$.\n",
    "At the same time, the elements of the matching regions are brought into correspondence. Generally speaking, one may distinguish between two categories of alignments: **global** alignments and **local**. In the global case, one forces the alignment to span the entire length of the two sequences. By contrast, in the local case, one tries to identify regions of similarity within \n",
    "longer sequences that are often widely divergent overall. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the [FMP notebook on dynamic time warping (DTW)](../C3/C3S2_DTWbasic.html), we have encountered a first alignment technique, where the alignment was mathematically modeled by the notion of a warping path. The **boundary condition** in this definition enforced that the two given sequences $X$ and $Y$ were aligned **globally**. Furthermore, one could adjust the degree of continuity in the alignment by suitably modifying the step size condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the context of [subsequence DTW](../C7/C7S2_SubsequenceDTW.html) used for [audio matching](../C7/C7S2_AudioMatching.html), the two sequences $X$ and $Y$ were treated in a different way. While the sequence $X$ had to be aligned as a whole, only a subsequence of the sequence $Y$ was sufficient as a matching counterpart. Therefore, this scenario required a **mixed global/local alignment** approach. Technically, the idea was to relax the boundary conditions for the sequence $Y$, where a suffix and a prefix could be left out in the alignment without any cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we deal with a **local alignment** problem, where for both sequences $X$ and $Y$ only **matching subsequences** are to be identified. To compute the matching, the boundary condition for both sequences $X$ and $Y$ is dropped. Furthermore, we need a second technical modification.\n",
    "In the previous two scenarios, having a global constraint at least on the side of the sequence $X$, the alignment was computed by considering a cost-minimizing path. Now, in the local scenario with no global constraints, such an approach would lead to an empty alignment. Therefore, we introduce a different optimization criterion by looking at a score-maximizing alignment based on a **score matrix** with **positive score** (relevant information) and **negative score** (irrelevant information). \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the boundary conditions considered, there are other factors that crucially influence the nature of an alignment result. For example, in **partial matching**, one drops the step size condition and replaces it by a much weaker monotonicity condition. The following figure summarizes the conceptual differences between different alignment scenarios. Further notes on the alignment variants can be found at the end of this notebook.\n",

    "## Formalization of Common Subsequence Matching Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our local alignment problem is motivated by the task of [version identification](../C7/C7_ContentBasedAudioRetrieval.html), where the assumption is that the query document and the database document share a similar tonal progression in certain parts, but we know neither the degree of similarity and the duration nor the locations where these concurrences occur. In this context, our matching task can be formulated as follows: given the sequences $X=(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)$  and $Y=(y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_M)$ over the feature space $\\mathcal{F}$, we are looking for a subsequence within $X$ and a subsequence within $Y$ such that these two subsequences are as similar as possible. Furthermore, in the comparison of these two subsequences, we want to be able to deal with temporal deformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the case of [subsequence DTW](../C7/C7S2_SubsequenceDTW.html), this task can be expressed in the form of an optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by using dynamic programming. However, we need to assume a different viewpoint on the given problem. In [subsequence DTW](../C7/C7S2_SubsequenceDTW.html), we looked for a **cost-minimizing subsequence** of $Y$ that matched the query $X$. This optimization criterion worked since the **entire** query sequence $X$ was forced to be matched against a subsequence of $Y$. Now, when we assume that only a **subsequence** of $X$ needs to be matched against one of $Y$, there is a trivial solution: the empty subsequences. Indeed, matching two empty sequences results in an overall cost of zero, which is an optimal solution when we assume that the cost matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ has no negative values. This is definitely not what we are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, we are not only looking for subsequences that can be matched with minimal cost, but also for preferably long subsequences that have a certain relevance. In other words, we need to balance two principles at the same time: \n",
    "\n",
    "* minimizing the overall matching cost on the one hand, and \n",
    "* maximizing the lengths of the subsequences on the other hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy this problem, we assume a **positive** viewpoint by using a **score matrix** (or **similarity matrix**) instead of a cost matrix. Then, instead of identifying cost-minimizing subsequences, we are looking for **score-maximizing subsequences**. Further constraints for the comparison of the subsequences are imposed by introducing negative penalty values as well as suitable step size conditions. Fixing a similarity measure $s:\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{F}\\to \\mathbb{R}$, we compute an $N\\times M$ score matrix by setting \n",

    "\\end{equation} \n",

    "for $n\\in[1:N]$ and $m\\in[1:M]$. The properties of this sore matrix can be further improved by using the same [enhancement](../C4/C4S2_SSM-PathEnhancement.html) as described for the case of self-similarity matrices. In particular, the application of [thresholding](../C4/C4S2_SSM-Thresholding.html) with respect to a threshold parameter $\\tau>0$ and a penalty parameter $\\delta\\leq 0$ turns out to be an important step. The score matrix is constructed in such a way that the cells that may express relevant similarity relations tend to have a positive score, whereas all other cells are given a negative score. This property is crucial in view of the following procedure, which tries to find a path component that accumulates a possibly large score. Such a path mainly lies in the positive part of $\\mathbf{S}$ while avoiding running through cells of negative score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further formalize our problem of finding a common subsequence, we need the notion of a path to account for temporal deformations when comparing two feature sequences. As in the context of [self-similarity matrices](../C4/C4S2_SSM.html) (see Section 4.2 of <a href=\"http://www.music-processing.de/\">[Müller, FMP, Springer 2015]</a>), a **path** is defined to be a sequence \n",

Thus, choosing $\\Sigma=\\{(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\\}$, this definition is the same as the one for a [warping path](../C3/C3S2_DTWbasic.html) except for having omitted the boundary condition. The reason for this is that we do not want to globally align the sequences $X$ and $Y$, but only subsequences. We associate for a path $P$ the two **induced segments** $\\pi_1(P):=[n_1:n_L]$ and $\\pi_2(P):=[m_1:m_L]$. The **score** $\\sigma(P)$ of $P$ is defined as \n",

Let $q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_\\ell$ be the iteratively determined cells, then the backtracking is stopped as soon as a cell $q_\\ell=(a,b)$ with $\\mathbf{D}(a,b)=0$ or $q_\\ell=(1,1)$ is reached. In the first case, the cell $q_\\ell=(a,b)$ is omitted since it has a nonpositive score $\\mathbf{S}(a,b)\\leq 0$. This yields the optimal path $P^\\ast=(q_{\\ell-1},\\ldots,q_1)$. In the second case the path starts with the cell $q_\\ell=(1,1)$ if $\\mathbf{S}(1,1)>0$ or with the cell $q_{\\ell-1}$ if $\\mathbf{S}(1,1)\\leq 0$."

    "## Partial Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the beginning of this notebook, one may further loosen the alignment requirements by replacing the **step size condition** by a much weaker **monotonicity condition**. This leads to an optimization problem referred to as **partial matching**. We now formalize this problem and provide an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming. Let $X=(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)$  and  $Y=(y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_M)$ be two sequences over the feature space $\\mathcal{F}$. A **partial match** of length $L\\in\\mathbb{N}_0$ between $X$ and $Y$ is defined to be a sequence $P=((n_1,m_1), \\ldots,(n_L,m_L))$ of cells $(n_\\ell,m_\\ell)\\in[1:N]\\times[1:M]$, $\\ell\\in[1:L]$, which is strictly monotonically increasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n_1<n_2<\\ldots < n_L \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad m_1< m_2< \\ldots < m_L.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a similarity measure $s:\\mathcal{F}\\times\\mathcal{F}\\to \\mathbb{R}$, we define the similarity matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ by $\\mathbf{S}(n,m):=s(x_{n},y_{m})$. Then, the total score \n",
    "$\\sigma(P)$ of a partial match $P$ is specified by \n",
    "$$\n",
    "   \\sigma(P) := \\sum_{\\ell = 1}^{L} \\mathbf{S}(n_\\ell,m_\\ell).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without giving detailed explanations, we provide in the following table a specification of the algorithm based on dynamic programming for computing an optimal (i.e., score-maximizing) partial match:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../data/C7/FMP_C7_E10.png\" width=\"600px\" align=\"middle\" alt=\"FMP_C7_E10.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the nested loop, the score value $\\mathbf{S}(n,m)$ is only added in the case of a diagonal step size&mdash;as opposed to the [DTW algorithm](../C3/C3S2_DTWbasic.html), where the cost value $\\mathbf{C}(n,m)$ is added in the case of all three step sizes. Furthermore, note that the optimal partial match yielding the accumulated score $\\mathbf{D}(n,m)$ does **not** necessarily end in the cell $(n,m)$&mdash;in contrast with the [DTW algorithm](../C3/C3S2_DTWbasic.html), where the optimal warping path yielding $\\mathbf{D}(n,m)$ always ends with the cell $(n,m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next code cell, we provide a reference implementation for the partial matching procedure, which is then applied to our toy example from above. Again note the index shift in the implementation due to the Python convention, where indexing starts with the index 0."

    "In this notebook, we have considered the problem of common subsequence matching, which can be regarded as a local variant of [DTW](../C3/C3S2_DTWbasic.html) and [subsequence DTW](../C7/C7S2_SubsequenceDTW.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The final optimal path crucially depends on the input score matrix, where one has to encode relevant information by cells with positive score and irrelevant information by cells with negative score. In the [FMP notebook on version identifiation](../C7/C7S3_VersionIdentification.html), we give an example for how to construct such a score matrix. Closely related is also the construction of such matrices in the context of [audio thumbnailing](../C4/C4S3_AudioThumbnailing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of using negative score values, one finds in the literature related approaches that use other kinds of penalty terms to account for the introduction of gaps and other discontinuities. Such an instance is the famous **Smith&ndash;Waterman algorithm**, which is widely used for the identification of common molecular subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replacing the step size condition by the monotonicity condition, we looked at the problem of **partial matching**. In the case of sequences over a finite alphabet (rather than elements in some Euclidean space), partial matching is closely related to the **longest common subsequence** (LCS) problem whose objective is to find the longest subsequence shared by two (or more) sequences."
